# Fan Controller system
This project aims to design a temperature-controlled fan system using the ATmega32 microcontroller, where the fan is automatically turned ON or OFF based on the temperature. The system uses an LM35 temperature sensor to provide continuous analog output, which is converted to digital values by the ADC in the microcontroller. The microcontroller then processes these values to control the fan speed and display the temperature on an LCD.

## Introduction
The Temperature-Controlled Fan System is a project designed to automatically regulate the speed of a fan based on the ambient temperature. It uses an LM35 temperature sensor to measure the temperature, which is then converted from analog to digital by the ADC in the ATmega32 microcontroller. The microcontroller processes this data to control the speed of a fan through PWM signals generated by Timer0 and displays the current temperature and fan state on an LCD.

## Functionalities
• Temperature Monitoring: The LM35 temperature sensor continuously measures the ambient temperature.

• ADC Conversion: The analog signal from the LM35 is converted to a digital value by the ATmega32's ADC.

• Temperature Calculation: The microcontroller calculates the actual temperature from the ADC value.

• Fan Speed Control: Based on the temperature, the fan speed is adjusted using PWM:
 
+  < 30°C: Fan OFF

+ ≥ 30°C: Fan at 25% speed

+ ≥ 60°C: Fan at 50% speed

+ ≥ 90°C: Fan at 75% speed

+ ≥ 120°C: Fan at 100% speed


LCD Display: The current temperature and fan state are displayed on an LCD.
